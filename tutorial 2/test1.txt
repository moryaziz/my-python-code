Python generators are easy way of creating iterators. It generates values one
at a time from a given sequence instead of returning the entire sequence at onc
e.\nIt is a special type of function which returns an iterator object.\nIn a ge
nerator function, a yield statement is used rather than a return statement.\nTh
e generator function cannot include the return keyword. If we include it then i
t will terminate the execution of the function.\nThe difference between yield a
nd return is that once yield returns a value the function is paused and the con
trol is transferred to the caller.Local variables and their states are remember
ed between successive calls. In case of the return statement value is returned
and the execution of the function is terminated.\nMethods like __iter()__ and _
_next()__ are implemented automatically in generator function.\nSimple generato
rs can be easily created using generator expressions. Generator expressions cre
ate anonymous generator functions like lambda.\nThe syntax for generator expres
sion is similar to that of a list comprehension but the only difference is squa
re brackets are replaced with round parentheses. Also list comprehension produc
es the entire list while the generator expression produces one item at a time w
hich is more memory efficient than list comprehension.THIS IS THE NEW CONTENT APPENDED IN THE FILETHIS IS THE NEW CONTENT APPENDED IN THE FILETHIS IS THE NEW CONTENT APPENDED IN THE FILETHIS IS THE NEW CONTENT APPENDED IN THE FILETHIS IS THE NEW CONTENT APPENDED IN THE FILETHIS IS THE NEW CONTENT APPENDED IN THE FILETHIS IS THE NEW CONTENT APPENDED IN THE FILETHIS IS THE NEW CONTENT APPENDED IN THE FILETHIS IS THE NEW CONTENT APPENDED IN THE FILETHIS IS THE NEW CONTENT APPENDED IN THE FILETHIS IS THE NEW CONTENT APPENDED IN THE FILETHIS IS THE NEW CONTENT APPENDED IN THE FILETHIS IS THE NEW CONTENT APPENDED IN THE FILETHIS IS THE NEW CONTENT APPENDED IN THE FILE
